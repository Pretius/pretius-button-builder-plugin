## What is Button Builder Plugin

Pretius Button Builder Plugin is an Oracle APEX region plugin developed by [Matt Mulvaney](https://twitter.com/Matt_Mulvaney) at <a href="https://www.pretius.com" title="https://www.pretius.com">Pretius</a>. 

This Plugin is a reimagining of Universal Theme's [Button Builder](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/apex_pm/ut/button-builder) as a Single Template Component. 

This allows you to show buttons in IR Columns with identical settings to the Universal Theme's Button Builder plus two new settings (Link & Custom Classes). See [Plugin settings](#settings) for more features.

| Size                  | Tiny, Small, Normal (default) Or Large Button                                           |
| Type                  | Stateful colors: normal, informational, danger, warning, and success                    |
| Style                 | Normal, Simple, Remove UI Decorations or Display as Link                                |

**Note**: A design decision was made not to render the button if the Label is null as the button looks unsual as **Text** or **Text with Icon**.
Whilst the button looks fine as **Icon**, there would be no Tooltip rendered therefore losing accessibility features. As such a Label is **always** required to render a button, even for Icon buttons. If you **really** need a blank button you can use the **\&nbsp\;** syntax as per the **COLUMN3** example below or copy this character -->Â <-- as your label.
